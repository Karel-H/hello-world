# hello-world
## First GitHub repository to get started

Welcome to my GitHub,
I started coding in R to handle the results of my diploma thesis and got hooked on how efficient it was.
ThatÂ´s when I decided that I would like to learn more and thus get more efficient and productive in handling data in general. 
I have recently completed a beginners class in Python and am currently working on another one. 

Up until mere two years ago, whenever I saw some piece of code anywhere I was aghast - it was totally foreign for me and I avoided it whenever I could,
because I had simply no background or understanding of it. Coding in school has come very shortly after my school years, and I always saw it as kind of 
a disability to be so ignorant and agnostic about it. BUT - with the encouragement of friends and colleagues, I have overcome this initial inner resistance 
and am very fond of it, now that I begin to understand, and would go so far as to that I am fascinated with the capabilities it holds.

In the very unlikely case anyone ever reads this, I hope you are doing well and that these lines may even serve as little bit of help to overcome initial insecurities :). 

All the best, have a nice day and stay safe!
